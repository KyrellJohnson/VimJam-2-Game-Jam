## The game

This was our first attempt at a full game.

This game was devloped and made for the 2021 Vimjam2 Game Jam. A 1 week game jam hosted by 8 Bits to Infinity.
For this game jam our team of 2 decided on devloping a top-down roguelike shooter. 

As the player you must clear each floor entirely for an exit to appear and to progress through each level.

Each level is randomly generated so each experience is unique.
